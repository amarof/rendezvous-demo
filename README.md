This a simulation of project that addresses the subject of the synchronous rendezvous of two mobile agents with distinct traces (tokens). The two agents, identified by different labels, are placed at nodes marked by different tokens in an anonymous graph. The exploration of the latter is necessary to have a complete map of the graph and subsequently, the agents must meet at the same node. In a round, a mobile agent can go to one of the nodes adjacent to its current node or remain motionless in the current location. We seek a deterministic algorithm that accomplishes rendezvous in optimal time.
